# Detailed list of sites using cname-cloacking, tracking or tracking advertising.


## Why ?

Cname-cloacking is in breach of European law (GDPR) and the law in many countries as they hide the DNS references to the site you are visiting. It is therefore impossible to obtain user consent for these third-party sites and the immediate effect is that you are tracked on all sorts of sites.

This is a more pernicious method than third-party cookies because it is tacit and without recourse.
It's a real goldmine for the companies that use it.

These companies can keep your data for as long as they like, since it does not officially exist. It could be your whole life.
 
Would you like to have a spy on your shoulder from morning to night, analysing your every move throughout the day, right down to the brand of toilet paper you use?

There is now a very important issue of energy saving and the autonomy of our connected devices. It makes good ecological sense.


## About this data

The data in these lists is public and accessible to anyone capable of using a DNS query tool such as nslookup, dig, drill or whois, etc. and their graphical equivalents.

Some web pages will go from 10 mb to 1 mb! (<https://www.laquadrature.net/2020/10/05/le-deguisement-des-trackers-par-cname/>). 
 
The bandwidth saved results in energy savings at all levels of the Internet from servers to hubs, right down to our devices.


## For Windows and Linux

You can install the excellent DNS software that also caches DNS unbound: https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/
You can then include the stub-zone list.

For a family or with the multitude of connected objects, installing Pi-hole is very effective: https://pi-hole.net/

These solutions offer huge savings in data and bandwidth, not to mention considerable energy savings.

For example, Pihole blocks 35-60% of advertising and trackers. This translates into a 50% increase in battery life for my Samsung smartphone.

I have created blocking lists for Pi-hole that you can download directly from the Pi-hole interface > Lists
* A list based on strict regexes of domain names
* A list based on regexes that take sub-domains into account


## For Android and IOS devices

Starting with the excellent ublock origin https://ublockorigin.com

I found a cool Privacy Badger extension <http://privacybadger.org> that doesn't block ads but all cnames and other vicious trackers.

To block advertising Adguard is stable. It is not permanently disabled on Chinese phones (ex: Huawei and others).

Adguard works on IOS and MacOs <https://adguard.com/fr/welcome.html>
